        \frametitle{Core Idea}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item OpenAPI generates Kotlin classes.
            \item Jackson uses reflection to create objects.
            \item Reflection is slow
            \item Spec contains all info needed to deserialize
            \item Generating the deserializer
        \end{itemize}

                \item Http Calls
                \item JSON model for input and output data
            \end{itemize}
            \item Generate model:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Code for most languages
                \item Model classes
                \item HTTP clients

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Jackson: 3 levels of parsing}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item JsonTokenizer
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Reads JSON as a stream, and divides into tokens
                \item FIELD, VALUE, START\_OBJECT, \ldots
            \end{itemize}
            \item NodeTree
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Reads JSON into a generic tree structure
                \item Primitives, Map<String, JsonNode>, List<JsonNode>
            \end{itemize}
            \item Custom Kotlin / Java Objects (Value)
            \begin{itemize}
                \item MyObj, List<MyObj>, Map<String, MyObj>
                \item Uses reflection to map to Kotlin objects
                \item Reflection is slow
            \end{itemize}
