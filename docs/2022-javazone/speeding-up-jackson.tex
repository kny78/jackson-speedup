        \begin{block}{OpenAPI-generator}
            OpenAPI generates Kotlin classes.
        \end{block}
        \begin{block}{Jackson}
            Jackson uses reflection to create objects from JSON. \\
            Reflection is slow.
        \end{block}
        \begin{block}{Generate deserializer}
            OpenAPI Specification contains the info needed to generate deserializers. \\
            Therefore we can generate the deserializer.
